# ada-wedge

John, here are some notes for you regarding my submission: 
*  Part 2 has an initial comment for how I handled part one of the wedge assingment.
* The folder Wedge PT 3 has the remaining products for the 3rd Part.
* I know you said no big files, but for the database upload it was considered a large file and used Git LFS for the transfer.

## Feedback

* All these headlines in the readme look üçås. I'm reformatting for you. 
* Part 2
  + For that first cell, just make that a markdown cell with nice writing rather than a big comment. I appreciate the comments however!
  + Resubmit this without all the owners printed to the screen. Re-read those submission guidelines on Moodle. 
  + Delete the cell where you print `sample_owners` to the screen. That variable name would be a bit clearer as a singular. 
* Part 3
  + A little weird to have this in a folder but not part 2. No biggie.
  + Otherwise this looks great and is **complete**.


## Changes
Made the the changes in part 2 as required.
Thank you for the feedback and sorry for the horrible original readme file.

Would it have made sense to put both part 2 and part 3 in their respected folders or should I have just left them in the main folder?

## Feedback 2

Nice work, thanks for the revisions. This exercise is **complete**. 

For the folders question, it's totally a judgment call. I usually only use sub-folders when I have a few different files 
that it makes sense to have in their own tidy package. (For instance, on a long project I'll usually do separate folders
for V1, V2, etc.) I think for this project it would have been fine to just have everything in its own top-level directory.
